Description:
    Stubs out a new controller and its views. Pass the controller name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of views as arguments.

    To create a controller within a module, specify the controller name as a
    path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers, view templates in
    app/views/controller_name, a helper class in app/helpers, a functional
    test suite in test/functional and a helper test suite in test/unit/helpers.

Example:
    `./makelos generate controller CreditCard open debit credit close`

    Credit card controller with URLs like /credit_card/debit.
        Controller:      app/controllers/credit_card_controller.php
        Functional Test: test/functional/credit_card_controller_test.php
        Views:           app/views/credit_card/debit.html.tpl [...]
        Helper:          app/helpers/credit_card_helper.php
        Helper Test:     test/unit/helpers/credit_card_helper_test.php

Modules Example:
    `./makelos generate controller admin/credit_card suspend late_fee`

    Credit card admin controller with URLs /admin/credit_card/suspend.
        Controller:      app/controllers/admin/credit_card_controller.php
        Functional Test: test/functional/admin/credit_card_controller_test.php
        Views:           app/views/admin/credit_card/debit.html.tpl [...]
        Helper:          app/helpers/admin/credit_card_helper.php
        Helper Test:     test/unit/helpers/admin/credit_card_helper_test.tpl
