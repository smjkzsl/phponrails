Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
    views, along with a full test suite. The resource is ready to use as a
    starting point for your RESTful, resource-oriented application.

    Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attributes.

    Attributes are a comma separated list of "field type" arguments 
    specifying the model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, 
    so you don't have to specify them by hand as 
    'created_at datetime, updated_at datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'scaffold post title,body,is_published'
    gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them all, as well as a resources :posts
    declaration in config/routes.php.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'script/destroy scaffold ModelName'.

Examples:
    `./makelos generate scaffold post`
    `./makelos generate scaffold post title,body,published boolean`
    `./makelos generate scaffold purchase order_id,amount decimal`
